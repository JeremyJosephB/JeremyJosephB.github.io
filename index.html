		<p>This is some crappy website I'm making to practice HTML and CSS </p>

		<div>
		<table border="1">
			<tbody>

				<tr class="rounded_rows">
					<th colspan="2">Forms are pretty hard.</th>
				</tr>

				<tr class="rounded_rows">
					<td colspan="2">I mean it's not the worst thing.</td>
				</tr>

				<tr class="rounded_rows">
					<th colspan="2">Still it's a bit difficult to set up.</th>
				</tr>

				<tr class="rounded_rows">
					<th colspan ="2">Which is why I put table instead.</th>
				</tr>
				
			</tbody>
		</table>
		</div>

		<div>
		<h1>This a list put here for the sake of having one.</h1>
		<h6>and completing the assignment.</h6>
			<ul> 
				<li>number one</li>
				<li>n√∫mero dos</li>
				<li>nommer drie</li>

	<p>Here's a <a id="website_link" href="http://www.w3schools.com">website</a> that's way better than mine that's about HTML. It's better than my website for many reasons. Such as looking good(I'm learnig how to so that better though). It also has functions that are very convenient such as the bar on the top of the page following you as you scroll down the page.</p>

	<footer>In case you were bored with this page. <a id="page_2_link" href="page_2.html">Page2>>></a></footer>
